# Programming-Projects
This repository contains my programming projects over the years. It contains my university coursework projects and a few apps which I created over the summer. Native Java apps and Mobile Android apps are included.

I also developed a comparison site for Forex brokers. The website can be found under the domain name - fxbrokermarket.com
